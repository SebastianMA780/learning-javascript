### Types of Data Structures
<details>
	<summary>Arrays or Lists:</summary>

- Arrays are ordered collections of information addressed by indexes. There are two types of arrays:
	- Static: A specific amount of memory is assigned because the number of data is fixed (slots).
	- Dynamic: The amount of memory is undefined, allowing you to make modifications to them.
