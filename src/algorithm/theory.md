# What is an Algorithm ?

An algorithm is a well-defined sequence of steps for solving a specific problem or task. It takes inputs, performs processing with the inputs, and produces an output if necessary.

  <summary>Choosing an Algorithm.</summary>
  
	Choosing an algorithm is a matter of finding the best algorithm for the problem at hand.
	The best algorithm is the one that is the most efficient in terms of time and space complexity.

	- Time Complexity: How much time does it take to run the algorithm?
		- We measure the algorithm in terms of time execution
		- The Timing is not in terms of specific cases, but in terms how time execution increases as the input size increases.

	- Space Complexity: How much memory does it take to run the algorithm?
		- Is responsible for the amount of memory used by the algorithm.
		- Auxiliary Space: The space used by the algorithm, not including the space used by the input.
			- Includes the space used by variables and data structures used to store the intermediate values
			- The auxiliary space is an important factor to consider while analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm as it directly affects the memory usage of the algorithm.
