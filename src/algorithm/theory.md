# What is an Algorithm ?

"An algorithm is a well-defined sequence of steps for solving a specific problem or task. It takes inputs, performs processing with the inputs, and produces an output if necessary."

## Structure of An Algorithm

	- Inputs
	- Processing
	- Output (optional)

## Choosing an Algorithm

"Choosing an algorithm is a matter of finding the best algorithm for the problem at hand. The best algorithm is the one that is the most efficient in terms of time and space complexity."

	- Time Complexity: How much time does it take to run the algorithm?
	- Space Complexity: How much memory does it take to run the algorithm?
